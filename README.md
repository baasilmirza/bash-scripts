## Thunderbolt Device Authorization

File: `scripts/thunderbolt-auth.sh`<br><br>
This script enables Thunderbolt device authorization on Linux systems. On many Linux distributions, Thunderbolt devices (such as docks, external GPUs, displays, and storage) are blocked by default for security reasons and require manual approval. The setting resets on reboot (non-persistent).
